title: About DataSD
---

DataSD is the Open Data Program run by the City of San Diego Performance & Analytics department.  The City is committed to the principles of open, accessible, efficient, and transparent government, as well the use of technology to help put those principles into practice.  

Mayor Faulconer created the Performance & Analytics Department on July 1, 2014.  Its purpose is to focus on citywide efficiency, accountability, and transparency initiatives.  On December 16, 2014, the Council passed the City's Open Data Policy with his strong support.

Opening up the City's data ties in directly with each of our Strategic Goals and allows us to monitor our progress in achieving them:

* Provide High Quality Public Service
* Work in partnership with all our communities to achieve safe and livable neighborhoods.
* Create and sustain a resilient, economically prosperous City.

The guiding principle for the program is to get the proper stakeholders with the right skills, involved in a timely manner, equipped with the appropriate technology and accurate data to facilitate good decisions and innovative solutions for our residents.

## What is Open Data?
The City collects, produces, and stores an enormous amount of data.  A few examples include:

* Crime data
* Parking meter data
* Traffic counts
* Street paving activity

The data currently reside in a range of isolated and non-integrated data repositories, in multiple incompatible formats, and are managed by non-interoperable platforms.  The data have the potential to drive deeper understanding of civic activity and policy, drive transparency and accountability, and make the City a more efficient and data-driven leader on the global civic landscape.

Properly enhanced and managed, the data has the potential to:

* Facilitate decision-making by staff and policymakers.
* Increase transparency, efficiency, and accountability.
* Improve information sharing and use by City employees.
* Allow the community to conduct analyses and build applications on top of the Cityâ€™s data.

The City is committed to guiding this potential towards reality. 

## Why is Open Data Important?

Open Data lets us:

* Allow taxpayers to benefit from a more **efficient**, agile government that is capable of being responsive to them and able to deliver more with the same level of resources.
* **Empower** people to build applications that assist residents, start businesses around those applications, and contribute to the overall **economic development** of the City.
* **Empower** consumers of City data-based applications to have the most up-to-date, accurate and relevant information at their fingertips.
* Allow City employees to be more **efficient** and innovative by allowing them to get data from other departments more quickly and in an easily consumable format.
* Be recognized globally as a city government that reflects and supports the innovation of our surrounding community.

## What are the Goals of DataSD?


### 1. Increase data literacy within the City and with those who interact with the City.
There are various levels of understanding of what are data, metadata, Open Data, etc.

### 2. Manage data as an asset, formalizing existing oversight and ownership.
Take existing data management and responsibility structures, build on them and formalize them to create a robust data management program that would prevent data duplication and rework, as well as ensure sustainability of Open Data release.

### 3. Release data to the public via a strategic and predictable process.
Data releases must account for a multitude of factors including communications with stakeholders, data integrity, personally identifiable information (PII), and ensuring that we describe and release data in a way that meets Open Format specifications.

### 4. Ensure that data are well described and catalogued.
Understanding what data we have is crucial to both Open Data and data management.  We worked with departments to create an initial inventory, and now we need to provide processes for how it can stay current.  

### 5. Support increased use of data in decision making, as well as innovations in Open Data use.
We have a talented City workforce that makes data-driven decisions every day.  In addition, fostering and expanding interest in government data from residents and other users is crucial to delivering the benefits of an Open Data program.
