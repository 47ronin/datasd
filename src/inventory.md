# Inventory Process

## Purpose
The purpose of the Data Inventory is to get a bird's eye view of data throughout our City departments that will assist stakeholders in identifying datasets they consider high value for publication.  However, we deliberately designed the inventory process to do much more, as follows:

* Establish a base level inventory of the data the City has at its disposal.
* Create and collect a base level of attributes describing our City's data.
* Establish a competent group of information coordinators across the departments.
* Identify people currently working with and managing data.
* Understand which of the City's software systems are authoritative for various pieces of information.
* Identify critical data and be able to prioritize it for release or internal access.

## Process Overview

The first part of the inventory was to identify information coordinators from each of the 35 departments/programs we engaged.  Most departments assigned a single point of contact to work with the Chief Data Officer.  However, several larger departments chose to assign multiple coordinators to represent certain divisions.  We sought out information coordinators that are knowledgeable in the business level--of how the department operates, and how users make decisions based on that knowledge.  In total, we worked with 65 coordinators.
